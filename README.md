# ProjectAPI
 a development porject for discovering, learning and implementing new features in API
<br>
<br>
currently using: 3.11.9 64bit python interperator from the Microsoft Store



## Steps to setup project
make sure for ``pip install...`` its in a powershell
1. `` pip install flask`` 
2. `` pip install requests``
3. ``pip install pygame``
3. Make sure to run ``app.py`` first to set up API
4. To run the UI file, make sure to run it in a dedicated Terminal



## Stuff happens, here are some error fixes:
* When importing doesnt go right and 'flask' is highlighted do this; Please use the shortcut key **(Ctrl+Shift+`)** to open a new VSCode terminal, it will automatically enter the currently selected environment, and then use the command "pip show flask" to check the installation location of the module "flask". Could perhaps fix requests? Haven't gone that issue yet...


### Notes:
* GET: request data from a specified resource 
* POST: create a resource
* DELETE: delete a resource
* PUT: update a resource
* Using Flask package
* 201 Status code: RETRIEVED correctly
* 200 Status code: CREATED correctly
